The Promise:
• Real-time financial sentiment tracking across the internet
• Social media, blogs, forums, news aggregation  
• Early warning system for market movements

The Numbers:
• Founded: 2005 by Roger Ehrenberg (ex-Deutsche Bank)
• Total Funding: $20M+ (Union Square Ventures, RRE Ventures)
• Shutdown: 2014

Target Market:

THE AUTOPSY: What Killed Monitor110

1. TECHNOLOGY GAP
2008 Reality:
• Basic keyword matching
• No context understanding  
• False positives everywhere

Example: "Apple is terrible" (the fruit) vs "Apple stock is terrible" (AAPL)

2. INFORMATION OVERLOAD
The Fatal Mistake:
• Showed users 10,000 mentions/day
• Expected humans to analyze manually
• No synthesis, just aggregation

"We gave them a firehose when they needed a faucet" - Former user

3. ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY
Trust Issues:
• No track record of predictions
• No proof of accuracy
• Recommendations disappeared

Users couldn't verify if it actually worked
```

### SLIDE 4: Market Analysis (30 mins)
- [ ] Create comparison table: Then vs Now
- [ ] Add market size numbers in large font
- [ ] Insert competitor logos (optional)

**Copy-Paste Text:**
```
THE TECHNOLOGY FINALLY EXISTS

THEN (2008) → NOW (2026)
• Keyword matching → Transformer models (GPT-4, Claude)
• Manual analysis → AI synthesis in seconds  
• Zero verification → Blockchain timestamping
• Desktop only → Mobile-first

MARKET OPPORTUNITY

💰 Market Size: $67 Billion (AI FinTech by 2027)
👥 Target Users: 50M retail investors (US alone)

📊 Current Solutions:
• Bloomberg Terminal: $24,000/year (institutions only)
• Seeking Alpha: Generic analysis, no AI
• Twitter/Reddit: Noise, no synthesis

🎯 The Gap: No AI-native tool for retail investors
```

### SLIDE 5: Design Objectives (20 mins)
- [ ] List 4 core objectives with checkmarks
- [ ] Create constraints table
- [ ] Add relevant icons: 📱 ⚡ 🔗

**Copy-Paste Text:**
```
WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

Core Objectives:
✅ Synthesize, Don't Aggregate → AI reads everything, shows ONE decision
✅ One-Click Actionable Signals → BUY/SELL/HOLD with confidence score
✅ Full Transparency → AI explains its reasoning in plain English
✅ Blockchain Verification → Every prediction timestamped on-chain

Design Principles:
• Mobile-first (80% of users on phones)
• Real-time updates (sub-10 second latency)  
• Source attribution (trust through transparency)
• Clean UI (inspired by original Monitor110)

Technical Constraints:
Constraint → Our Solution
• API rate limits → Caching + batch processing
• LLM token costs → Claude Haiku ($0.25/1M tokens)
• 7-hour build time → Fork existing DugTrio codebase
• Blockchain gas fees → Story Protocol testnet (free)
```

### SLIDE 6: System Architecture (35 mins) ⭐ CRITICAL
- [ ] **📷 Insert:** `assets/architecture_new.png` ⭐ NEW (MAIN VISUAL)
- [ ] Create 4-layer diagram (use SmartArt or shapes)

- [ ] Add arrows showing data flow
- [ ] List technologies in each layer

**Copy-Paste Text:**
```
TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

📊 DATA LAYER (Multi-Source Aggregation)
├─ NewsAPI → Financial news (50+ sources)
├─ Twitter/X API → Social sentiment
├─ Reddit API → r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks
└─ Alpha Vantage → Real-time stock prices

🧠 AI LAYER (Dual Intelligence)  
├─ RoBERTa → Fast sentiment baseline
│   • 125M parameters
│   • 0.3 sec inference time
└─ Claude 3.5 Haiku → Synthesis + Reasoning
    • Analyzes RoBERTa output
    • Generates structured signals
    • Explains decisions

🔗 TRUST LAYER (Blockchain Verification)
└─ Story Protocol (Sepolia Testnet)
    • Timestamps predictions
    • Creates immutable track record
    • Enables verification

💻 PRESENTATION LAYER
├─ React + Vite (Frontend)
├─ FastAPI (Backend)  
├─ TailwindCSS (Styling)
└─ Recharts (Data Visualization)
```

### SLIDE 7: Core Technical Contribution (25 mins) ⭐ CRITICAL
- [ ] **📷 Insert:** `assets/innovation_comparison.png` ⭐ NEW
- [ ] Highlight 3 innovations
- [ ] Use comparison format (Others vs Us)
- [ ] Add icons for each innovation

**Copy-Paste Text:**
```
WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT

🎯 1. Dual AI Architecture
Fast Path (RoBERTa): Sentiment baseline in 0.3 seconds
Deep Path (Claude): Understands context, generates reasoning

Why This Matters:
• Monitor110 had ZERO AI (just keyword counts)
• Competitors use single models (either fast OR smart)
• We get BOTH: Speed + Intelligence

🔗 2. Blockchain Verification Layer  
Every prediction gets:
• Timestamp (when we called it)
• Confidence score (how sure we were)
• On-chain hash (immutable proof)

Why This Matters:
• NO other team has accountability
• Users can verify our track record
• Builds trust through transparency

📊 3. Multi-Source Synthesis
We combine: News AND Social AND Prices
Result: Weighted synthesis → More accurate signals

THE UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION:
"We're the ONLY platform that combines dual AI, blockchain proof, and multi-source data"
```

### SLIDE 8: Functional Prototype (25 mins)
- [ ] **📷 Insert:** `assets/user_flow.png` ⭐ NEW
- [ ] Create feature checklist table
- [ ] Add user flow diagram
- [ ] Include mockup/wireframe (optional)

**Copy-Paste Text:**
```

## SPEAKER NOTES TEMPLATE

**Slide 1:**
"Good evening judges. We're reviving Monitor110—a startup that raised $20 million and failed because they tried to build AI before AI existed. Today, we're bringing it back as Sentient110."

**Slide 2:**
"Monitor110 was ahead of its time. Founded by a Deutsche Bank trader, they wanted to track financial sentiment before social media was mainstream."

**Slide 3:**
"They failed for three specific reasons: technology gap, information overload, and zero accountability. These aren't just flaws—they're our opportunities."

**Slide 4:**
"The market has changed. In 2008, they had keyword matching. Today, we have GPT-4 and Claude. The $67B AI FinTech market proves demand exists."

**Slide 5:**
"Our design philosophy: synthesize, don't aggregate. Monitor110 showed 10,000 posts. We show ONE decision with full transparency."

**Slide 6:**
"Our architecture has four layers. Data aggregation, dual AI processing, blockchain verification, and user presentation. This isn't just an API—it's an intelligence pipeline."

**Slide 7:**
"Three innovations: dual AI for speed and intelligence, blockchain for accountability, multi-source for accuracy. No other team has all three."

**Slide 8:**
"In 7 hours, we're building a working prototype with core features: search, analysis, signals, reasoning, and blockchain proof."

**Slide 9:**
"Let's be honest. We have strengths but also limitations. Every limitation has a mitigation plan. This is MVP—the roadmap shows production scale."

**Slide 10:**
"Simple freemium SaaS. Year 1 projection: $4.78M revenue at 92% margin. Five-year vision: acquisition by Robinhood for $500M+."
